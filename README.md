# RND
Adults always say, "don't do this, don't do that." However, children always like to try new things, and so do I. So I create this token so that more people can do what they like to. Anyone who wants more free time can come and claim my airdrop.  $RND tokens issued a total of 37.8 trillion, of which 12% was left to my mom and dad. It was their dedication and love over the past 12 years that gave me the opportunity to create this token. 38% of the total amount shall be subjected to liquidity mining. 50% of the total will be airdropped to 101010 people. Airdrop will be claimed within 1 year. After 1 year, the unclaimed tokens will be destroyed directly. In order to encourage more people to claim the airdrop, we will airdrop a larger share of tokens to the top 1010 people who come to claim for tokens.  When making this airdrop website, I encountered many difficulties, some because of the lack of information on the Internet, especially in the front-end connection to solidity.  Therefore, I will publish the source code of my website on GitHub for exchange and learning. I hope those who want to build Smart Contract can learn more conveniently from my code.  P.S. My dad always say there is no such thing as a free lunch, well, let's wait and see. Maybe $RND is.
